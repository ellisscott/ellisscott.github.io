Our company also offers a range of pallet trucks. A electric forklift (also called lift truck, jitney, fork truck, fork hoist, and forklift truck) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials over short distances.</p>

We have specialized in new and used forklift sales in Surrey, Vancouver and surrounding areas for over 41 years.
