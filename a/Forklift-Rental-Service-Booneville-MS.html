<p>Do you want to add some ride height to your vehicle? High load carrying capacity polyurethane wheels & rollers to protect floors. Whether you need to move heavy loads in a warehouse or construction field, forklifts can safely lift objects humans cannot, making them indispensable on any job site. Standard 1910.178 covers all aspects of forklift operator training, from fuel handling and charging batteries to truck operation and maintenance.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>
