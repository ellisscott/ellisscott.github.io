<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing. It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians. While it can't reach difficult angles the way that a telehandler can, it is capable of lifting payloads much higher off the ground than a warehouse forklift and heavier loads.</p>

<h3>Interesting Forklift Facts and History in Vicksburg MI 49097</h3>
<p>Like the LHM230P, the BT Pro Lifter, LHT100 is designed to work with minimal starting force for increased productivity during horizontal transport and loading operations. However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>The machine known as a stockpicker is an electric forklift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads. Body lifts can increase the height of a truck by up to three inches and can allow for larger tires on the truck. A "lifted truck" is a truck whose suspension has been modified to accommodate larger tires, usually 35 inches or bigger.</p>
