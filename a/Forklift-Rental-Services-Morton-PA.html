Drivers of counterbalance forklift trucks are responsible for transporting goods and materials. After all, raising a vehicle's ride height will potentially impact brake lines, steering geometry, and custom four-link systems as well.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

<p>United Rentals was founded in 1997 and is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

<p>Simply put, a pallet jack is a large tool used to lift and move heavy pallets. Along with selling new and used forklifts, ProLift offers forklift rentals Using a rental is ideal when the need for a forklift is limited - as short as 1 day - or you have a sudden or unexpected need. We provide the best Warranty in the business and can offer outstanding Lease & Finance packages.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
