<p>The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system. A forklift is any mechanical device, powered by an electric motor or internal combustion engine that is used to move or lift loads. In fact, most body lift kits are designed to work with suspension lift kits. Here, Linde uses protective operator platforms in the pallet trucks and equips pedestrian models with protective combined braking and assistance systems: The reverse current brakes are automatically active when the operator releases the drive pedal or switch.</p>
