This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars.
