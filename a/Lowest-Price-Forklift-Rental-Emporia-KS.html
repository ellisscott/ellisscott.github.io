<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity. This is used, for example, when the tires on one side of the forklift are up on a mound of dirt and the tires on the other side are down in a rut.</p>
