<p>Linde is constantly developing its order pickers, aiming to make working conditions even safer and more ergonomic for operators, which is why, for example, the latest generation of order picking devices feature an even lower entry height.

<p>Offering a cabin for all weather conditions, and with Toyota SAS as standard, our 8-Series engine powered forklifts are ideal for outdoor use. This program discusses common hazards presented by the operation of reach trucks and how to control those hazards through safe operating techniques. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.</p>
<p>Still, gas forklifts are more popular for many outdoors jobs. Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency. Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
