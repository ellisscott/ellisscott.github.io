<p>Non-serious injuries related to forklift accidents reach 61,800 each year in the USA. In my region, paper mills call them tow motors,” warehouses may refer to them as stackers,” and builders tend to use telehandlers” in lieu of rough terrain forklifts.” OSHA uses the all-encompassing phrase powered industrial trucks,” or PITs, when referring to forklifts in its 1910.178 standard.</p>

In addition to lift truck sales, we also sell the full line of Multiquip equipment, including generators and light to medium duty construction equipment.</p>
<p>Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>

Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck.

<p>A pallet jack that is too long will make it difficult to maneuver around your warehouse, and one that is too short may not fully support the load and become an unstable safety risk. Robotic technology is estimated to be used across the Class III Forklift Trucks over the forecast period. If you plan to use a rough terrain forklift in a confined space, dimensions are important.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>

Included with the compressor will be a revolutionary "smart sensor" used to make sure your truck is always sitting at the proper ride height, regardless of what you are loading or towing.</p>
