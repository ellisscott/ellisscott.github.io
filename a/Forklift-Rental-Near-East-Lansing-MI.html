<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight. Roe Osborn Rough terrain forklifts (or telehandlers) were designed to move material from off-loading zones closer to jobsites and to lift manageable loads to elevated work areas.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
