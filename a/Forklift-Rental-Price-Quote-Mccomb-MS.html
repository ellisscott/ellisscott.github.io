Secure your individual switching bonus for replaced electric forklift trucks with lead-acid battery. All Crown forklifts feature heavy-duty designs for demanding applications.

Forklifts can unload pallets of bricks, construction materials and steel joists from the delivery truck and transport them to the job site. The frame, cab, boom, and body of a tele-scoping-boom rough terrain forklift are usually fabricated by the forklift manufacturer.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work.
