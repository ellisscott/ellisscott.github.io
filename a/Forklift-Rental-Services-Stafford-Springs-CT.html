<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty.

If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
