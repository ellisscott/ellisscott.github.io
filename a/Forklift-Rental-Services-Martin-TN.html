Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids.

<h2>Pallet Lift Martin</h2>
<p>Corporate rates are offered by some larger rental companies. Since they can work on all kinds of job sites, rough terrain forklifts are some of the most versatile small machines.

They offer a streamlined credit approval process so you can rent forklifts (and other equipment, if needed) without paying the full price up front.</p>
