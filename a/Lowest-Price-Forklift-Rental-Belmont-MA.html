<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget.

Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>
<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months.

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
