<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature.

Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>

Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties. Also, the use of technologically well-versed forklift trucks in this region is gaining maximum traction and supplementing the growth of the truck industry.</p>

For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
