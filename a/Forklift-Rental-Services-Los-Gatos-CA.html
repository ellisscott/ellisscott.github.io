Ohio Power Tool carries a vast selection of pumps - including dewatering, diaphragm, sewage, sump, and trash varieties - from top names in tool manufacturing ( Chicago Pneumatic , Greenlee , Multiquip , RIDGID , and Wheeler-Rex ).

The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
