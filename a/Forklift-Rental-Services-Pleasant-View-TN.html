Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>

<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
