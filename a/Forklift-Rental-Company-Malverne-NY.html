Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications. With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below). Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.

<p>However, when you purchase a used forklift, operators will already be familiar with the forklift operations and can easily take over the job. We are offering Manual Pallet Truck to our client and our product is made of good quality.

<p>Order pickers do exactly what their name implies - they pick” orders in a warehouse for stores, other distribution centers, retail centers, and more.

You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years.</p>
<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
