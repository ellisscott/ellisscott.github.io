Browse through the vast selection of machines that have recently been added to our inventory.</p>
<p>In addition our finance department has warranties that can give you peace of mind with your new lifted truck. In most instances, renting a forklift makes more sense than buying one.

<p>At our GMC dealership near Rocky Mount and Goldsboro in Wilson, we offer professional upgraded lifted GMC trucks. Forklifts use rear wheel steering. My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity.</p>
<h3>Material Handling Safety Tips Rialto CA 92376</h3>
<p>But with lift kits, the danger is a little different. Towering over most other folks on the road also provides a greater view into the distance, which is a plus when driving on regular roads and when off-roading. Airide air bag suspension springs are manufactured by Firestone for heavy truck, trailer and bus for applications such as steering axle, seat, cab mount, drive axle, lift axle, and primary trailer air suspension.</p>
<p>And if you wish to use our forklifts and pallet trucks for longer periods or permanently, we can make you various attractive offers. The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. Having completed the required Rough Terrain Forklift Training will also keep your company in compliance.
