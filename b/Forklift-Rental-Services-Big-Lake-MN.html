However, it does suggest that people without previous experience driving a lifted truck should test-drive one of a similar height before lifting their own.</p>

While these two lift kits are somewhat similar, there are important differences between them. This will provide them with the necessary certifications to be able to use forklifts legally in their job. Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
