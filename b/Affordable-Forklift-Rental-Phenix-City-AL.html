<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>Based on region, the global pallet truck market can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and South America. That's very good for an electric forklift. These changes can actually improve the handling of a pickup, however, and there is no limit, beyond a practical one, to how much lift this kind of kit can give a truck. Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
