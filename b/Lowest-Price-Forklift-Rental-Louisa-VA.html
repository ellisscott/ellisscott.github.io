<p>When you need power out of your forklifts, turn to Tynan for all the power you can handle. Employers must certify that operators have received all necessary training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years.

<h2>The Electric Pallet Truck Louisa </h2>

Our company also offers a range of pallet trucks. A electric forklift (also called lift truck, jitney, fork truck, fork hoist, and forklift truck) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials over short distances.</p>
<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
