We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
