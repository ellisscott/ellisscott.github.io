<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO. This is because the center of gravity for a loaded life is actually the combined center of gravity for both the lift and the load. The damage that can be done by this forklift can be to objects and people other than the operator.

<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>
