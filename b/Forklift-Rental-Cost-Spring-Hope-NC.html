<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
