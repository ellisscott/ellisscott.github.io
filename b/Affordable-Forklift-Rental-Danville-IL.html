Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift. Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>
