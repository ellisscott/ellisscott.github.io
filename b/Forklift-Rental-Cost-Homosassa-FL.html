<p>We are largest supplier adn importer of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck. It creates physical equilibrium at the forklift height and an equivalent force from the Gas and the Forklift's Load. Operators should be able to successfully demonstrate the proper lifting, traveling, and placement of a load, as well as express basic knowledge about the forklift's controls and features.</p>
