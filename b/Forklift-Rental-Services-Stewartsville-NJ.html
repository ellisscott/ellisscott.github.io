<p>Application Hydraulic hand pallet truck is widely used in various industries to lift loads. Altorfer Lift Truck is proud to be a member of the Material Handling Equipment Distributors Association (MHEDA). In October 1998, dealers that sell Toyota industrial vehicles and equipment changed their names to 'Toyota L&F' (logistics and forklift).

At the trucks' heart is advanced AC drive technology, which combines improved torque, efficiency and control with minimal maintenance needs.</p>
