We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>

<h2>Pallet Lift Equipment Ward </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>Maintain forklifts in safe condition free of defective or missing parts through daily visual checks and regular preventive maintenance. Whether you're looking for an energy efficient electric forklift , an LP-gas forklift , a high-capacity diesel lift truck , or specialty equipment to handle the most strenuous heavy lifting projects, our rental fleet of high performance Hyster and Yale forklifts is at your service.</p>

Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
