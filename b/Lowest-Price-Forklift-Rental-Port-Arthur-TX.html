<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Reliable and easy-to-use, our all-terrain forklifts for hire provide great performance for your workplace. The first reason is obvious Sun Equipment does not want you to purchase the wrong used forklift for sale or spend more than you need on a used forklift with features that you will never use. For anyone who is an adventurous individual or need a truck with significant size and power, then you really have to test drive one of our lifted trucks.</p>

Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>A little more lifting capacity means the 3,500 lb. forklift can do more than the 3,000 lb. But you don't have to sacrifice the small footprint, as the truck sits on the same size frame.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary.
