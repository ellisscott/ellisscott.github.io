<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift.

<p>Counterbalance forklifts are most commonly used indoors in settings such as warehouses and retail spaces. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when load is raised to maximum lift height.

<p>Typically, these types of vehicles are known as forklifts or lift trucks. When you buy a pallet truck then you will come across many varieties in the market. It is common for indoor electric forklifts to use cushion tires. Rough terrain forklifts are essential material handling equipment on many worksites. A different type of forklift is to be used. Other key features include an intuitive multi-function control handle, patented open view mast, low step height, ductile iron baselegs and an exclusive suspension system for superior load stability.</p>
<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
