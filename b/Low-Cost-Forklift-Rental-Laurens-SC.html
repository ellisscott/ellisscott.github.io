On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc.

We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>
<p>The PTH Series pallet jack is designed for smooth, and quiet operation and easy handling so operators experience less fatigue and work more efficiently. Commonly lifted vehicles include most pickups and large SUVs, especially the Ford Excursion Any vehicle designed for off-road use, however, can be lifted. Counterbalance forklifts are just one of several types of forklifts found in today's workplaces.</p>
<h2>What Kind of License Do I Need to Drive a Forklift in Laurens </h2>
<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving.

DaytonÂ® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. These powerful machines can handle very heavy loads and operate on all kinds of difficult terrain.

<p>Rough terrain forklifts might look like they can only tackle one type of job. These are nice Crown order picker lift trucks with low hours and in good working order. For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic. Because of the high initial cost, almost all forklifts are either rented or financed.</p>
