Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>

The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>
<h2>Pallet Stacker Cedar Rapids</h2>

If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>

They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>This allows the reach truck to place pallets of products into shelving. All forklift operators should be certified and keep their training up to date, for their safety and that of those around them. With solutions for indoor and outdoor operations, warehouse and distribution centers to rugged terrain applications, we have the right forklift for your business when you need it.</p>

Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
