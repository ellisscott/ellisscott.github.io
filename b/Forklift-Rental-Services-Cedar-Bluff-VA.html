Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
<p>Off-roading tests the limits of both your Jeep and you as a driver. There are extensive ranges of forklifts available which include pedestrian operated machines to heavy duty driver operated trucks. The special handle design offers protection for the operator's handle and makes raising loads and steering easier. These forklifts travel at high and fast speeds.
