The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support.

<p>Double Reach Trucks are commonly used in factory, food processing and general warehousing industries.

A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast. There's no better way to move equipment and materials around a factory or work site than with a forklift.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks come with a tilt mechanism in the cab to help the driver gain a better view of the operation. FORKS: Horizontal tine-line projections, normally suspended from the carriage, for engaging and supporting loads. Designed for terrain that pneumatic tire forklifts can't handle. Best for: Toyota's electric order picker is ideal for many types of operations and industries including: warehouse order picking, and Third Party Logistics (3PL) companies with square footage over 10,000 square feet.</p>

Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control.
