This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle.
