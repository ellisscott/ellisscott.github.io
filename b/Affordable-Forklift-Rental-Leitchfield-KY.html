<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

<p>Average forklifts for everyday usage start at a lift height of eight feet and go all the way up to 20 feet, but there are units that reach far above those levels. 55. 55 Rule: Employees will not place any part of their bodies outside the running lines of an industrial truck or between mast uprights or other parts of the truck where shear or crushing hazards exist.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>

You might notice less suspension damping during long trips and on rough, uneven roads, but this only tends to be an issue if you're lifting your truck more than a few inches.

A pallet jack, also known as a pallet truck, 1 pallet pump, pump truck, scooter, dog, 1 or jigger 1 is a tool used to lift and move pallets Pallet jacks are the most basic form of a forklift 2 and are intended to move pallets within a warehouse.</p>
