<p>Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement.

<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
