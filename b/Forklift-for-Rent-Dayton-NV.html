<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane. Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.” This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>

<p>We manufacture, export, import and supply a wide range of equipment for Floor Transportation comprising of Electric Pallet Trucks, Scissor Hand Pallet Trucks, Hydraulic Hand Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks. Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>

The forklift experts at Northland Industrial Truck Co., better known throughout New England as NITCO , have hundreds of rental units on hand and are skilled at helping you figure out what options are right for your business.

Can be used indoors and outdoors for loads 2,000lbs+.</p>
<h2>Lift Truck Price Dayton</h2>
<p>Unused pallet jacks are a major trip hazard. Electric forklifts are battery-powered and will generally last through one standard shift before needing to be recharged.

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>

Our forklift rental programme is backed by the strength and flexibility of our branch network. The difference is that only the mast moves and not the front tires like an articulated forklift.</p>
